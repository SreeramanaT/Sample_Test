Rules of Integration with Jenkins
=================================================
# PRE - YOUR TOOL must be running with Access details.

Step 1 - INSTALL Tools PLUGINS
http://35.154.114.196:8080/pluginManager/

Step 2 - Configure Jenkins with a tools details.
http://35.154.114.196:8080/configure

Step 3 - USE in the JOBS.
        FoR JIRA        
        1. I SHOULD KNOW WHICH COMMIT is made for which JIRA TICKET
        2. Job failed - Created a Ticket and assign a to one.

Step 4 - Verify
